# IoT

Rest Backend developed using SpringBoot which manages requests from IoT device (Automatic Hand Sanitizer dispenser). It has the following features

1. Handles authentication of devices
2. Manages device state and status of the level
3. Sends email when the level is below threshold

The application was deployed to Amazon Web Service (AWS) using docker in an EC2 instance. Also, a mobile application was developed using kotlin to visually track the level and control the device remotely
